# Teachers Portal

A registration system created for the Salt Spring Centre of Yoga. Used to manage the display of classes on the website, student registrations, class cancellations etc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The current version of this project uses Firebase as the database. In the future I would like to switch this to MySQL.

### Prerequisites

Node.js
Yarn

### Installing

1. Clone this repo locally using:

```
git clone https://github.com/jessejburton/sscy-teachers-portal .
```

2. Ensure you have Node and Yarn installed, from within the folder run

```
yarn install
```

3. Lastly run the following command to run a dev server locally with the project running on http://localhost:8080

```
yarn run dev-server
```
